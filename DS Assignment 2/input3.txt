After these operations are precisely specified, the implementation of the program may start. The 
implementation decides which data structure should be used to make execution most efficient in terms of 
time and space. The study of data structures, a fundamental component of a computer science education, 
serves as the foundation upon which many other computer science fields are built.
An item specified in terms of operations is called an abstract data type.
